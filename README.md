# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
Automated Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using Deep Learning and Image Analysis

This project focuses on the detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from retinal images using a deep learning approach. Diabetic Retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes, and early detection is crucial for preventing vision loss. This repository presents a solution for binary classification, distinguishing between 'Diseased' and 'Healthy' retinal images.

The project employs a fine-tuned ResNet50 model as the base for feature extraction. The base model's weights are initialized with 'imagenet' and its top layers are removed (include_top=False). A custom classification head is added on top of the ResNet50 base.

The final accuracy of the model is recorded as 94.2%.
